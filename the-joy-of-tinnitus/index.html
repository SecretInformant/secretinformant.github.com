<p>There is fun to be extracted from the mis-heard, mangled messages that the brain compiles.<br/>
 It is perhaps a reversion to an earlier stage of one’s life.<br/>
  It has echoes of the litany that a child mindlessly repeats using words that are meaningful, although contextually incorrect. <br/>Consider a catholic child praying: ”Hairy Mary, fell off grass”</p>

<p>I have discovered that these errors may be named Mondegreens or Oronyms.<br/>
A mondegreen is a mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase as a result of near-homophony,<br/>
 in a way that gives it a new meaning, the Oronym is typified by the “Four Candles”/”Fork Handles” sketch.<br/>
  Spot the difference.</p>

<p>I haven’t given all the translations. Work them out. I had to.</p>

<li>Alex Salmond, at the Scottish Nationalist Party conference (April 2014):<br/> “The yes campaign is positive, uplifting, hopeful and must always stay that way…<br/>This is our moment. To be a pig in a poke. Our country, our Scotland and our independence.” <br />This one I did have to check for a correction. It apparently should have been heard as, “a Beacon of Hope”. Not “a pig in a poke”.</li>
<br/>
<li>A reader, by the unlikely name of Ivor Supermarket, reports hearing of a "Tesco World Heritage Site" on the radio.<br/>
The United Nations obviously need a catchy phrase. Every Little Helps.</li>

<br />
<p>Please submit your own experiences of mis-heard overhearings(?).</p>

<p>There is a variation on this topic. Just as incorrect hearing can lead to odd interpretation, so too can incorrect viewing. This whole field, both auditory and visual, could potentially lead to a replacement for the venerable Rorschach Ink Blot Test. Consider the Freudian implications of the following examples:- </p>
<br/>
Out on a ramble I spotted a mobile cleaning service van with the catchy business title "Busty Dusters". I excitedly pointed this out to my fellow walker. He calmly pointed out that the title was the more prosaic "Busy Dusters". Palpable disappointment all round.
<br/>

On a bus recently I was idly scanning an advertisment for fast food. The poster included a small round logo with the words "Mini First Dump" printed round some indecipherable shape. This seemed a strange logo. My brain suggested a closer inspection. A second reading produced "Mini Fist Pump". I am still no wiser, but more accurately informed.
